### Library Management System

This is a **Library Management System** project developed in Java. The system helps manage library operations such as adding student details, adding books, issuing books, and returning books. This application streamlines the management of library resources and provides a user-friendly interface for librarians and students.

## Features

- **Add Student Details**:
  - Record and manage student information such as name, ID, contact details, and course.
  - Ensure easy retrieval and updating of student records.

- **Add Book**:
  - Add new books to the library database with details such as title, author, genre, ISBN, and quantity.
  - Maintain an organized and searchable catalog of library resources.

- **Issue Book**:
  - Issue books to students by linking the book details with the student's information.
  - Track issued books, including the due date and status.

- **Return Book**:
  - Manage the return of books and update their availability in the database.
  - Calculate and record late fees if applicable.

- **Search and View Records**:
  - Search for books or student details using various filters.
  - Display comprehensive information on books and students.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL
  - Tables for students, books, issued books, and return records.
- **IDE**: NetBeans (or any Java-supported IDE)
- **Additional Tools**:
  - JDBC for database connectivity.
  - Apache POI (optional) for exporting data to Excel files.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
   ```
2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., NetBeans, Eclipse).

3. Set up the database:
   - Install and configure MySQL on your system.
   - Create a new database (e.g., `library_db`) using MySQL Workbench or command-line tools.
   - Execute the provided SQL script (`database.sql`) to create the necessary tables and sample data.

4. Update the database connection settings in the project:
   - Open the `dbConfig.java` file in the project.
   - Update the following parameters with your MySQL details:
     ```java
     String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3307/library_db";
     String user = "your-username";
     String password = "your-password";
     ```

5. Build and run the project in your IDE.

## How to Use

1. **Launch the Application**:
